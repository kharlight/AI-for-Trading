#### 3. Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization.[Project 3](https://github.com/mbindzi/AI-for-Trading/tree/master/Projects/3-%20Smart%20Beta%20and%20Portfolio%20Optimization%20Project)
##### 3.1 Learning Objectives
In the course leading up to the project, the objective is to learn about portfolio optimization, and financial securities formed by stocks such as market indices, vanilla ETFs, and Smart Beta ETFs.
##### 3.2 Project Specifications
Create portfolios using smart beta methodology and optimization. Evaluate the portfolio performances by calculating their tracking errors. Calculate the turnover of the portfolio and find the best timing to rebalance. Come up with the portfolio weights by analyzing fundamental data and by quadratic programming.
#### 4. Advanced Portfolio Optimization. [Project 4](https://github.com/mbindzi/AI-for-Trading/tree/master/Projects/4-%20Advanced%20Portfolio%20Optimization%20Project)
Also referred to as "_**Alpha Research and Factor Modeling**_"
##### 4.1 Learning Objectives
In the course leading up to the project, the learning objective is to get to know more about alpha factors and risk factors, and construct a portfolio with advances portfolio optimization techniques
##### 4.2 Project Specifications
Research and generate multiple alpha factors. Apply various techniques to evaluate the performance of alpha factors and learn to pick the best ones for the portfolio. Formulate an advanced portfolio optimization problem by working with constrainsts such as risk models, leverage, market neutrality and limits on factor exposures.

#### 5. NLP on Financial Statements. [Project 5](https://github.com/mbindzi/AI-for-Trading/tree/master/Projects/5-%20NLP%20on%20Financial%20Statements%20Project)
##### 5.1 Learning Objectives
In the course leading up to the project, the learning objective is to get acquainted with fundamentals of text processing and use them to analyze corporate filings and generate sentiment based trading signals.
##### 5.2 Project Specifications
Apply Natural Language Processing on corporate filings such as 10Q and 10K statements, from cleaning data and text processing to feature extraction and modeling. Utilize Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF to generate company-specific sentiments. Based on the sentiments, decide which company to invest in, and the optimal time to buy or sell.
#### 6. Sentiments Analysis with Neural Network. [Project 6](https://github.com/mbindzi/AI-for-Trading/tree/master/Projects/6-%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Project)
##### 6.1 Learning Objectives
